      "stem": "A 2 year old girl was brought to the emergency department with sudden severe hematemesis. History revealed umbilical sepsis during neonatal period. The child appears pale and physical examination reveals a firm spleen palpable 7 cm below the costal margin. She does not exhibit hepatomegaly, ascites or lymphadenopathy. Which of the following is the most likely diagnosis?",
      "options": [
        "Hepatic vein thrombosis",
        "Liver cirrhosis",
        "Portal vein thrombosis",
        "Vasoocclusive disease"
      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient's history of neonatal umbilical sepsis followed by severe hematemesis, firm splenomegaly without hepatomegaly, ascites, or lymphadenopathy, is characteristic of pre-hepatic portal hypertension due to portal vein thrombosis. Umbilical sepsis can lead to thrombophlebitis of the umbilical vein, which is the most common cause of portal vein thrombosis. The bleeding from hematemesis is typically due to esophageal varices, a consequence of portal hypertension."

      ],
      "correct": 2,
      "explanation": "The patient's prolonged jaundice, hepatomegaly, and elevated liver enzymes for 7 months, with negative markers for hepatitis A, B, and C, suggest a diagnosis of chronic hepatitis. Since viral causes have been ruled out, the next step is to investigate for non-viral causes, such as autoimmune chronic hepatitis, which is diagnosed by testing for hypergammaglobulinemia and autoantibodies."

        "The patient has pre hepatic portal hypertension.",
        "The patient never presents with melena"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "A 10-year-old boy with recurrent hematemesis, abdominal distention, and dilated abdominal veins, along with ascites and hepatomegaly, has signs of portal hypertension. Hematemesis is a medical emergency that requires an emergency endoscopy to identify and treat the source, which is most likely bleeding esophageal varices."

      "stem": "A neonate aged 3 weeks develops jaundice at birth, associated with pale clay colored stools. On examination the patient has yellowish green jaundice, microcephaly and hepatosplenomegaly. Which of the following investigations may be diagnostic?",
      "options": [
        "Abdominal ultrasound",
        "ALT, AST and serum bilirubin",
        "Hepatitis markers",
        "Torch screening"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "The neonate presents with jaundice, pale stools, microcephaly, and hepatosplenomegaly. Microcephaly is a key finding that is suggestive of congenital infections such as TORCH infections, which are a known cause of neonatal cholestasis. Therefore, TORCH screening would be the most appropriate diagnostic investigation."

        "Thrombocytopenia.",
        "Vitamin E malabsorption"
      ],
      "correct": 1,
      "explanation": "The presence of several bruises in a jaundiced infant with hepatomegaly indicates a bleeding tendency. In cases of cholestasis and liver disease, there is fat malabsorption leading to deficiency of fat-soluble vitamins, including Vitamin K. This, in turn, causes hypoprothrombinemia, resulting in bleeding and bruising."

        "Liver biopsy is essential for diagnosis",
        "Protein restriction is the mainstay of treatment",
        "The condition may be due to biliary atresia"
      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The clinical picture of fever, anorexia, abdominal pain, and vomiting, followed by jaundice and tender hepatomegaly, is a classic presentation of acute hepatitis. However, anicteric hepatitis, where jaundice is absent, is a common form of the disease, especially in infants."

        "Examination of infant's blood smear",
        "Urine analysis and culture"
      ],
      "correct": 3,
      "explanation": "A 14-day-old infant with a total bilirubin of 14 mg/dl and a direct bilirubin of 5 mg/dl has neonatal cholestasis. Sepsis is a common infectious cause of neonatal cholestasis, so urine analysis and culture are important investigations to rule out a urinary tract infection as a potential cause."

      ],
      "correct": 0,
      "explanation": "The patient presents with symptoms of acute hepatitis. The key findings are the elevated INR that did not respond to vitamin K and the low albumin level. This indicates a severe impairment of the liver's synthetic function, which, along with the recent onset, is diagnostic of acute liver cell failure, also known as fulminant hepatitis."
